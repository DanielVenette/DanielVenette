## Hey there! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub page! I'm Dan, a seasoned engineering professional with expertise in programming languages like Python 🐍, SQL 📊, VBA 💻, R 📈, HTML 🌐, and CSS 🎨.

🔨 I've spent over 11 years working as a field engineer in the oil and gas industry, honing my skills in data analysis 📉, problem-solving 🤔, and project management 📈. I've got a strong track record of delivering high-quality solutions that have resulted in increased efficiency and productivity 🚀.

👨‍💻 When I'm not working, you'll find me tinkering away on various coding projects. Here are a few highlights:

    📜 Directional Drilling Report Automation: Developed an automated morning reporting process using Visual Basic for Applications and a Baker Hughes SQL Server database, resulting in a 50% reduction in daily reporting time.

    🍻 Stamford Happy Hour Finder: Developed a responsive website that integrated Google Maps API and PostgreSQL database, utilizing Flask framework.

    🌄 Image Watermarking Software: Designed and developed a software program that automatically watermarks images, providing a professional and secure way to showcase visual content.

    🐸 Frogger Clone: Developed a recreation of the classic arcade game, Frogger, using Python's Turtle graphics library.

    ⚡ Harry Potter Quiz Game: Developed a GUI-based Harry Potter quiz application using Python's tkinter library, the Requests module, and the HP-API.

👷‍♂️ I've also got experience working as a technical support engineer and manager, collaborating with software engineering teams to identify, troubleshoot, and resolve complex technical problems related to software products.

📚 In addition to my hands-on experience, I hold a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degree in Engineering Physics 🚀 and a Master of Business Administration (M.B.A.) degree in Finance 📈.

👨‍💼 I'm always looking for new challenges and projects to work on, so feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn at linkedin.com/in/danielvenette and check out more of my work on GitHub!
